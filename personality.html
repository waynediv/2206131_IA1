      <h2>My Hero</h2>
      <p>Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is someone I truly admire—not just for his literary genius but for his ability to think outside the box and challenge conventional ideas. His whimsical storytelling and inventive characters sparked creativity in generations, showing that imagination is a powerful tool for problem-solving and innovation.</p>

      <article>
        <p>According to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, I am an <strong>Idealist</strong>. This partially aligns with my personal values, especially my drive to create meaningful and purpose-driven solutions. However, I also lean heavily on analytical thinking, which the test didn’t fully reflect. While such assessments provide useful insights, they can oversimplify our full range of traits.</p>
